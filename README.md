## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Merve, I have experience in backend development, database design and artificial intelligence. I have developed my knowledge and skills in these areas by working on various projects. I enjoy identifying deficiencies in business processes and producing creative solutions. I like to achieve my goals by working in a disorganised but efficient way.
